				Media theorist Wendy Chun once differentiated the computer from other tools and formal systems through its relationship to simulation and simulated worlds. “While most tools produce effects on a wider world of which they are only a part, the computer contains its own worlds in miniature” (1).

				Computer worlds, like those of children’s make-believe, grant absolute power to whoever is imagining or programming them (2). As reality is drafted into digital environments, the computer simulation offers the opportunity to create worlds and bodies without unwanted complexity. It allows us to devise private games and internally consistent worlds in the face of absurdity and paradox. Advances in computer imaging technology towards “photorealism” further seduce us into believing that we are looking at concrete realities rather than ideological assemblages of math and code. As reality is increasingly reflected through the small mirrors of digital simulation, we risk losing sight of the mysterious nature of our lived reality.
